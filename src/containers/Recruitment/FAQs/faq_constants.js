    question: "What makes PSE different from other organizations?",

      {
        type: "text",
        content:
          "PSE differentiates itself from other business fraternities and organizations both in its learning philosophy and specialization. We prepare our brothers with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in today's business world, but go further to provide opportunities to utilize and hone these skills within projects across various industries. PSE hosts networking opportunities and corporate infosessions with professionals and alumni, and puts its members in positions to become their best possible professional selves. But PSE provides far more than professional development - as a fraternity, we are an intimate, close-knit environment where brothers can build strong personal relationships, and lasting friendships."
